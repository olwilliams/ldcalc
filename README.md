# ldcalc
Linear dichroism simulator with rotation diffusion
This program is used to calculate the linear dichroism observed when a rhodopsin-containing membrane vesicle
is excited with a polarized light source such as a laser. If ldcalc is ran without inputs, it uses a default
set of parameters. Any parameters you wish to change from default can be given in a structure field, e.g. 
input.sphereposition.
